## Introduction

The **Multi-Modal RAG WebApp** combines the power of **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** with **multi-modal input processing**. It leverages external knowledge sources to provide precise, context-rich answers to user queries and supports both **text** and **image** inputs for a seamless, interactive experience.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Modal Input**: Accepts both textual and visual inputs.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Integrates external data sources (e.g., databases, documents, web APIs) for enhanced answer accuracy.
- **Dynamic Knowledge Retrieval**: Fetches real-time or context-specific data based on queries.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Adaptable pipeline for different use cases such as education, e-commerce, healthcare, or customer support.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive web-based UI designed for smooth interactions.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Built with scalability in mind, deployable on cloud platforms or local servers.

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Frontend**: Built using modern web technologies (e.g., React, Vue.js) for responsive design.
2. **Backend**: Powered by a Python/Node.js server that handles RAG pipelines and multi-modal processing.
3. **Knowledge Base**: Supports multiple data sources, including:
   - Document stores (e.g., PDFs, CSVs, databases).
   - Web scraping and APIs for live data.
4. **Multi-Modal Model**: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, CLIP for image understanding).
5. **Integration Layer**: Connects to APIs and other external services.
